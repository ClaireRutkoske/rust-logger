# Rust Logger
Simple Rust exercise that logs an `entry` to a file

## Description
The program accepts an entry description and then prompts the user for tags. Each entry is added to the `log` file as:
`timestamp`,`entry`, `tags`

After each entry, the program will give you the option to `1:add` another or `0:exit`.


## Usage
Start the program, and follow the prompts:

```sh
$ cargo run
```
